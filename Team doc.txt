Game Info: Once the game starts running the player will be shown a timed start screen which follows up with a menu where
the player can press space. After they have pressed space they are shown a screen which shows help, play or exit,
Help shows the player how to play the game and returns them to the main menu after they press escape.
If they press the exit the game just closes and if the player presses play they are immediately brough to the game screen.
When on the main game screen the player can move left and right with the corresponding arrow keys. Should they press the up 
arrow key mario will begin jumping upwards and will slowly fall back down. Once the player drives off the left or right side of 
the screen the game ends and brings you back to the main menu.
